            <p>Doctrine is a component of the strategy cycle, as described by <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley">Simon Wardley</a> in <a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">his book on mapping</a>. By examining the doctrine in an organization, you can get an idea of how adaptable it is and how well it will respond to external change or gameplay. You can do this with your own organization, or with other organizations.</p>

            <p>Grab 10-15 people across the organisation (at different levels) and get them to colour the boxes in. Be warned, there'll be lots of arguments but that's not a bad thing.</p>

            <p>Once you've assessed the status quo of doctrine in your organization, you can go about addressing areas of weakness. Simon suggests you do this in phases. The remainder of this page presents his best guess at the order in which you should tackle them.</p>

            <p>You can <strong>select cells to highlight them</strong> as you think, discuss, and challenge assumptions. You can <strong>click multiple times to progress through colors</strong> indicating a neutral, weak, warning, and good status.</p>

            <th>The focus in this first phase is simply awareness and removal of duplication. The aim is not to radically change the environment but to stop further damage being caused. Hence the emphasis is on understanding your user needs, improving situational awareness, removing duplication, challenging assumptions, getting to understand the details of what is done and introducing a systematic mechanism of learning — such as the use of maps with a group such as spend control.</th>

            <th>While phase 1 is about stopping the rot, phase 2 builds upon this by helping us to start considering and using the context. Hence the emphasis is on using appropriate tools and methods, thinking about FIRE, managing inertia, having a bias towards action, moving quickly, being transparent about what we do, distributing power and understanding that strategy is an iterative process.</th>

This is the phase which is most about change and moving in a better direction whereas the previous phases are about housekeeping.</th>

This is the point where strategic play comes to the fore and where we design with pioneers, settlers and town planners. The emphasis is on constant evolution, use of multiple cultures, listening to outside ecosystems, understanding that everything is transient and exploiting the landscape.</th>
