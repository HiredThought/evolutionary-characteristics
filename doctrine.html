		    <p class="lead">The doctrine list is simply a list of <strong>universally useful patterns</strong>.</p>
		    <p>Doctrine is a component of the strategy cycle, as described by <a href="https://twitter.com/swardley">Simon Wardley</a> in <a href="https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec">a book on mapping</a>. By examining the doctrine in an organization, you can get an idea of how adaptable it is and how well it will respond to any gameplay. You can do this with your own organization, or with other organizations.</p>
		    <p>Grab 10-15 people across the organisation (at different levels) and get them to colour the boxes in. Be warned, there'll be lots of arguments but that's not a bad thing.</p>
		    <p>Once you've assessed the status quo of doctrine in your organization, you can go about fixing it. Simon suggests you do this in phases. The remainder of this page presents his best guess at the order in which you should tackle them.</p>
		    <p>You can <strong>select cells to highlight them</strong> as you think, discuss, and challenge assumptions. You can <strong>click multiple times to progress through colors</strong> indicating a neutral, weak, warning, and good status.</p>

What you want to avoid is taking exceptional people out of their role and putting them into something they are not suited to simply because they think that is the only way to progress. Leadership, management and engineering are all aptitudes, they are all valuable and they have to work in concert. If the hierarchy of your organisation uniformly reflects your pay scales then you’re likely to be draining talent from where it should be and putting it into roles that it is not suited for. This is often done for arguments of “responsibility” or “managing bigger teams” (which also causes people to try and accumulate empires) or “spreading experience” or “career path” but there are alternative ways of achieving this. Taking a gifted engineer and turning them into a mediocre project manager is not wise. This is probably one of the most difficult areas as ego is quickly encountered.">Seek the best</td>
